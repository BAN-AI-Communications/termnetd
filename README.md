# Termnetd: Network serial port daemon

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/70ba0f08f4af44b187db549c9be4cf0b)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/BAN-AI-Communications/termnetd?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=BAN-AI-Communications/termnetd&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

Termnetd (aka termpkg apparently) is a cool little application that lets you
stream serial port data over the network. It's a terminal server daemon that
exposes the serial port and tty devices directly to a network port.

## Installation

First Get the repository, execute the configure script, change directory to the
platform detected and run the `make` command:

    git clone git@github.com:carlos-jenkins/termnetd.git
    cd termnetd
    ./configure
    cd linux
    make

## Configuration

Once installed, the configuration file, `/etc/termnetd.conf`, can be edited to
configure which serial port maps to which network port. It can be used to set
serial port connection settings as well. The format is as follows:

    <IP port>:<state>:<device>:<termios options>;

**Example:**

    3000:on:/dev/ttyS0:B115200 CLOCAL IGNBRK CRTSCTS CS8 CREAD;

## Usage

Start termnetd by running from the command line:

    termnetd

From another terminal use telnet or netcat to receive the data

    nc localhost 3000
