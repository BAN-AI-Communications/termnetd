	Linux systems.


10/10/98 Version 3.0

	Added the ttyd command to allow use of remote serial devices by
	any program.

	Added uucp style serial device locking.

06/28/98 Version 2.05
	Modified termnetd to use sigaction instead of signal. This should
	make the server more robust in handling the death of children.

	Added a Control Port for checking and modifying the 
	status of the ports.

02/21/97 Version 2.03 -> 2.04
	Fixed nasty bug causing the server to die when DTR was pulled from
	a serial device

11/15/96 Version 2.00 -> 2.03

	(In other words I got lax keeping this log up to date, SORRY!)

03/16/96 Version 1.07 -> 2.00

	Moved  the  Special  telnet  options  to begin with 1. Because most
	telnet  daemons  do  not respond to the options, a 5 second timeout
	was  added.  If  this  timeout  expires,  it  is  assumed  that any
	responses  for  the  special termnet options have been received and
	normal execution will proceed.

	Added SCO DEC OSF the list of Unix flavors that the program runs on

	Completely overhauled the configuration files for termnetd. They
	now allow for using termios tags for the serial device configuration

02-02-96 Verion 1.06 -> 1.07

	Fixed the Telnet Option handshaking that caused telnet to go into
	LINEMODE when connecting to the server.

	Removed the -l and -r options from termnet and replaced them with
	the -e option to provide local echoing. Also changed the echo command
	to accept either on or off instead of local and remote. These changes
	were brought on by the first change.

	Added TELOPT TTYPE and TELOPT XDISPLOC option handshaking to termnet
	to provide a reasonable environment when connecting to telnet servers
	for login purposes.
